[REQS] This is script is compiled to run on Ubuntu 16LTS and above with python3 support.

The purpose of this script is to find the encrpyted bit for a color in a hexadecimal 
format without the # as found in HTML and CSS.

To run this command, simply type a hex color as the first parameter.

eg: ./osprey_app-{0} FFFFFF

Optionally you may pre-fix this first command with a digest format on 
how you would like to see the data of the sbit.

-sha3-256 (default)
-sha3-256-hex
-sha3-512
-sha3-512-hex

eg: ./osprey_app-{0} -sha3-256-hex ffffff
